### Telcom Customer churn Prediction with classification-model

> Given the large number of customers the Telecommunication industry service providers have and the competitive nature of their products/services, the rate at which customers can stop using one provider's product/service in preference for another provider is high. Moreover, the providers can't afford the time to have dedicated attention to each client so that they know when they are dissatified with their products/services and the cost of acquiring a new client as compared to maintaining an existing one is very high.
>
> Therefore, Telcos have a pressing need to use their data from customer interactions to predict with high accuracy the customers that are likely to switch from using their products/services so that they can invest in mitigation startegies to maintain those clients, thereby, increasing their market position and profits.
>
> In this project we utilize the Vodafone Corporation data and Machine Learning models to predict with high accuracy the likelihood of a customer stopping the use of its products/services. We will also identify the factors affecting customer churn and suggest strategies the Telco can deploy to retain a high percentage of its customers.
